# Shipments [](id=shipments)

When customer places an order, it must be placed into a shipment. An order can
be packaged as a single shipment or broken into multiple shipments (support for
combining multiple shipments into a single order will be added at a later date).

To view open shipments, go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Shipments*.
To create a new shipment, follow these steps.

1.  Click the [Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button.

2.  Select an order number from the dropdown. Only orders included products that
    have not yet been placed in a shipment will be displayed. Click *Save*.

3.  A list of all the products in the selected or are displaced. Choose any or
    all to include in this shipment. Click Save.

4.  Enter a carrier name and a tracking number if applicable. Set the shipment's
    status. Enter an estimated shipping date and delivery date, and click
    *Save.*

To split an order into multiple shipments, simply repeat the above process,
selecting the same order in step 2. Of course, you won't have this option if you
selected all of the order's products in step 3 the first time through.

You can return to shipment at a later time, either to add or remove products or
to update it's status:

1.  Go to *Site* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr *Shipments* and select a shipment from
    the list.

2.  To update a shipment's status, make a selection from the *Status* dropdown and
    click *Save*.

3.  To add or remove products from the shipment, click on the *Items* tab. To
    add products, click
    on the [Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button, choose products from the
    list that displays, and click *Save*. To remove a product, click
    [options](../../images/icon-add.png) &rarr; *Delete*.
