# Catalog Rules [](id=catalog-rules)

Catalog Rules manage the catalog's visibility. They work with 
[user segments](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/user-segmentation)
to restrict specified buyers so they can only see a limited portion of the
catalog. This can help focus the attention of customers only authorized
to purchase products associated with a particular support plan, or who want the
convenience of only seeing parts and accessories for equipment they already
own.

Follow these steps:

1.  Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog Rules* and click on the
    ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button.

2.  Give the rule a *Name*, check the box next to *Active*, and select
    *Categories* from the *Type* drop-down box.

3.  Click the *Select* button that appears and select the categories 
    you want specified users to be able to see. Click *Done*.

4.  Click *Save*. A new tab, *User Segments*, appears at the top of the page.

5.  Click on *User Segments* and then click the
    ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button. Select the segment or segments
    that should be limited to the selected categories. Click *Add*.

**Note:** In step 2 above, the only type of rule available specifies a section
of the catalog by category. With the development of additional code, you can add
other custom types, allowing sections of the catalog to be selected by
individual product, by specification, or by other criteria.
